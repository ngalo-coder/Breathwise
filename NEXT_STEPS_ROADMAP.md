# üåç UNEP Air Quality Platform - Next Steps Roadmap

## ‚úÖ Current Status: DASHBOARD WORKING!
- Frontend displaying real Nairobi monitoring zones
- Policy recommendations from intervention data
- Real-time statistics and alerts
- Color-coded air quality visualization

---

## üéØ PHASE 1: Enhanced Visualization (1-2 days)

### 1.1 Add ArcGIS Interactive Map
```bash
# Get free ArcGIS API key from developers.arcgis.com
# Add to frontend/.env:
VITE_ARCGIS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Create Interactive Map Component:**
- Real-time air quality overlay
- Click zones for detailed info
- Policy intervention boundaries
- Heat map visualization

### 1.2 Improve Dashboard UI
- Add charts for PM2.5 trends
- WHO air quality guidelines reference
- Mobile-responsive design
- Export data functionality

---

## üéØ PHASE 2: Real-time Data Integration (2-3 days)

### 2.1 Connect to Live Data Sources
- **OpenAQ API**: Your `openaq_import.py` script
- **Satellite Data**: Sentinel-5P for regional coverage
- **Weather Data**: Wind patterns affecting pollution
- **Traffic Data**: Real-time congestion correlation

### 2.2 Automated Data Pipeline
```python
# Schedule hourly data updates
# Add to crontab or Windows Task Scheduler:
0 * * * * cd /path/to/project && python openaq_import.py
```

### 2.3 WebSocket Real-time Updates
- Live PM2.5 readings
- Instant policy alerts
- Real-time map updates

---

## üéØ PHASE 3: Advanced Policy Engine (3-4 days)

### 3.1 Machine Learning Integration
- **Source Attribution**: Identify pollution sources automatically
- **Prediction Models**: Forecast air quality 24-48 hours ahead
- **Impact Assessment**: Predict policy effectiveness

### 3.2 Policy Simulation Engine
- Test "what-if" scenarios
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Population health impact modeling
- Economic impact calculations

### 3.3 Automated Policy Triggers
- Threshold-based interventions
- Emergency response protocols
- Stakeholder notifications

---

## üéØ PHASE 4: Multi-City Expansion (2-3 days)

### 4.1 Country Configuration System
```javascript
// Add support for multiple cities
const cities = {
  nairobi: { bounds: [36.70, -1.40, 37.12, -1.15], thresholds: {...} },
  kampala: { bounds: [32.45, 0.20, 32.75, 0.45], thresholds: {...} },
  lagos: { bounds: [3.15, 6.35, 3.55, 6.65], thresholds: {...} }
};
```

### 4.2 Multi-language Support
- English, French, Arabic, Swahili
- Localized policy templates
- Cultural adaptation of interventions

### 4.3 Regional Comparison Dashboard
- Cross-city air quality comparison
- Best practices sharing
- Regional policy coordination

---

## üéØ PHASE 5: Production Deployment (2-3 days)

### 5.1 Database Setup (Choose One)
**Option A: PostgreSQL + PostGIS (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install PostgreSQL with spatial extensions
# Full geospatial capabilities
# Scalable for multiple cities
```

**Option B: Cloud Database**
```bash
# AWS RDS with PostGIS
# Azure Database for PostgreSQL
# Google Cloud SQL
```

### 5.2 Cloud Deployment
**Recommended: Vercel + Railway**
- Frontend: Deploy to Vercel (free tier)
- Backend: Deploy to Railway (free tier)
- Database: Railway PostgreSQL

**Alternative: AWS/Azure**
- More scalable for enterprise use
- Better for UNEP's infrastructure requirements

### 5.3 Security & Authentication
- Auth0 integration for UNEP staff
- Role-based access control
- API rate limiting
- Data encryption

---

## üéØ PHASE 6: Advanced Features (Ongoing)

### 6.1 Mobile Application
- React Native app for field workers
- Offline data collection
- GPS-based monitoring reports

### 6.2 Stakeholder Portal
- Public air quality dashboard
- Policy transparency portal
- Community engagement features

### 6.3 Integration with UNEP Systems
- Connect to existing UNEP databases
- Automated reporting to headquarters
- Integration with country offices

---

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (This Week)

### Priority 1: Add Interactive Mapping
1. Get ArcGIS API key (free): https://developers.arcgis.com
2. Create map component with your Nairobi zones
3. Add click interactions for detailed zone info

### Priority 2: Real-time Data Updates
1. Schedule your `openaq_import.py` to run hourly
2. Add WebSocket updates to frontend
3. Create data refresh indicators

### Priority 3: Enhanced Policy Features
1. Add policy impact simulation
2. Create policy approval workflow
3. Add cost-benefit calculations

## üìä Success Metrics

**Technical Metrics:**
- ‚úÖ Dashboard loading < 3 seconds
- ‚úÖ Real-time data updates every hour
- ‚úÖ 99.9% uptime for production deployment

**Impact Metrics:**
- üìà Number of cities using the platform
- üìà Policy interventions implemented
- üìà Air quality improvements tracked
- üìà Population health benefits measured

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools Needed

### For ArcGIS Integration:
```bash
npm install @arcgis/core
# Free developer account at developers.arcgis.com
```

### For Charts and Visualization:
```bash
npm install recharts chart.js react-chartjs-2
```

### For Real-time Features:
```bash
npm install socket.io-client
# Backend already has socket.io
```

### For Mobile App (Later):
```bash
npm install -g @react-native-community/cli
```
